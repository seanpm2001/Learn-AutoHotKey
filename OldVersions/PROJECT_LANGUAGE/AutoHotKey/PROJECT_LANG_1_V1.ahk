; About:
; I decided to make AutoHotKey the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-AutoHotKey) as AutoHotKey is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the AutoHotKey programming language. It only makes sense to make AutoHotKey the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
